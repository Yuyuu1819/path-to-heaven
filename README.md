Path to heaven is a web based social media where we hope to make people's lives easier, healthier and better. Our team Yuliette Nu√±ez, Alejandro Segovia and Manuel Riveros is working hard to bring this awesome project from a simple figma draft to a tool for bettering lives. 

Choose health, choose Path to heaven.

This proposal was born as an answer to the school's Intern Club summer hackathon for Sophomores-to-be, where we were tasked with creating an innovative social media platform.
